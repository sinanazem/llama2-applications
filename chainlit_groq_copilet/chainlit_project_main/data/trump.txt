Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021. Having won the 2024 presidential election as the nominee of the Republican Party, he is the president-elect and will be inaugurated as the 47th president on January 20, 2025.

Trump graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Becoming president of the family real estate business in 1971, he focused on luxury accommodation. After a series of business bankruptcies in the 1990s, he launched side ventures. From 2004 to 2015, he produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice.

Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican nominee. His immigration policy included ordering a travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries, expanding the U.S.–Mexico border wall, and implementing a family separation policy. He rolled back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations, signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and nominated Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2018, he initiated a trade war with China. He withdrew the U.S. from international agreements on climate, trade, and the nuclear program of Iran. He met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un without progress on denuclearization. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, he downplayed its severity, contradicted guidance from international public health bodies, and signed the CARES Act economic stimulus. He was impeached in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and in 2021 for incitement of insurrection; the Senate acquitted him in both cases.

Trump's politics and rhetoric led to the Trumpism movement. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged, racist, and misogynistic. He promoted conspiracy theories and made false and misleading statements during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics. After his first term, scholars and historians ranked him as one of the worst presidents in American history. He lost the 2020 presidential election but did not concede, falsely claiming widespread electoral fraud and attempting to overturn the results, including through his involvement in the January 6 Capitol attack. In civil proceedings, Trump was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation in 2023, and financial fraud in 2024. In May 2024, he was found guilty of falsifying business records, making him the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. He faced more felony indictments related to his interference in the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents, which were dismissed after his victory in the 2024 election.

Early life and education

Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in Queens, New York City, the fourth child of Fred Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump.[1] He is of German and Scottish descent.[2] He grew up with his older siblings, Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth, and his younger brother, Robert, in a mansion in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens.[3] He was a millionaire in 2024 dollars by age eight.[a][4]

Trump attended the private college-preparatory Kew-Forest School through seventh grade.[5] He was a difficult child and showed an early interest in his father's business.[6] His father enrolled him in New York Military Academy, a private boarding school, to complete secondary school.[7]

In 1964, Trump enrolled at Fordham University. Two years later, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,[8] graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science in economics.[9] He was exempted from the draft during the Vietnam War due to bone spurs in his heels.[10] In 2015, he threatened his high school, colleges, and the College Board with legal action if they released his academic records.[11]

The couple divorced in 1990, following his affair with model and actress Marla Maples.[13] He and Maples married in 1993 and divorced in 1999. They have one daughter, Tiffany (b. 1993), whom Maples raised in California.[14] In 2005, he married Slovenian model Melania Knauss.[15] They have one son, Barron (b. 2006).[16]

Health
Main article: Age and health concerns about Donald Trump
Trump says he has never drunk alcohol, smoked cigarettes, or used drugs.[17][18] He sleeps about four or five hours a night.[19][20] He has called golfing his "primary form of exercise", but usually does not walk the course.[21] He considers exercise a waste of energy because he believes the body is "like a battery, with a finite amount of energy", which is depleted by exercise.[22][23] In 2015, his campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician, Harold Bornstein, stating that he would "be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency".[24] In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three of Trump's agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on Bornstein's office.[24][25]

Views
Many of Trump's comments and actions have been described as racist.[26] In national polling, about half of respondents said that he is racist; a greater proportion believed that he emboldened racists.[27] Several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled his political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters.[28] Racist and Islamophobic attitudes are a powerful indicator of support for Trump.[29] He has also been accused of racism for insisting a group of black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger case, even after they were exonerated in 2002 when the actual rapist confessed and his DNA matched the evidence. In October 2024, the men sued Trump for defamation after he said in a televised September debate that they had committed the crime and killed the woman.[30]

In 2011, when he was reportedly considering a presidential run, Trump became the leading proponent of the racist "birther" conspiracy theory, alleging that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the U.S.[31] In April, he claimed credit for pressuring the White House to publish the "long-form" birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent, and later said this made him "very popular".[32] In September 2016, amid pressure, he acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S.[33] In 2017, he reportedly expressed birther views privately.[34]

Answering questions about the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville
Trump has a history of belittling women when speaking to the media and on social media.[35][36] He made lewd comments, disparaged women's physical appearances, and referred to them using derogatory epithets.[36] At least 25 women publicly accused him of sexual misconduct, including rape, kissing without consent, groping, looking under women's skirts, and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants. He has denied the allegations.[37] In October 2016, a 2005 "hot mic" recording surfaced in which Trump bragged about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that, "when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab 'em by the pussy."[38] Trump characterized the comments as "locker-room talk",[39][40] and the incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during his 2016 presidential campaign.[41]

Real estate

Starting in 1968, Trump was employed at his father's real estate company, Trump Management, which owned racially segregated middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs.[43][44] In 1971, his father made him president of the company and he began using the Trump Organization as an umbrella brand.[45]

Roy Cohn was Trump's fixer, lawyer, and mentor for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s.[46] In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the U.S. government for $100 million (equivalent to $686 million in 2023)[47] over its charges that Trump's properties had racial discriminatory practices. Trump's counterclaims were dismissed, and the government's case was settled with the Trumps signing a consent decree agreeing to desegregate.[48] Helping Trump projects, Cohn was a consigliere whose Mafia connections controlled construction unions.[49] Cohn introduced political consultant Roger Stone to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government.[50]

Between 1991 and 2009, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses: the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, the casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts company.[51]

Manhattan and Chicago developments
Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.[52] The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged for him by his father who also, jointly with Hyatt, guaranteed a $70 million bank construction loan.[44][53] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel,[54] and that same year, he obtained rights to develop Trump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[55] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's PAC and was his primary residence until 2019.[56]

In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel with a loan from a consortium of sixteen banks.[57] The hotel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992, and a reorganization plan was approved a month later, with the banks taking control of the property.[58] In 1995, he defaulted on over $3 billion of bank loans, and the lenders seized the Plaza Hotel along with most of his other properties in a "vast and humiliating restructuring" that allowed him to avoid personal bankruptcy.[59][60] The lead bank's attorney said of the banks' decision that they "all agreed that he'd be better alive than dead".[59]

In 1996, Trump acquired and renovated the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street, later rebranded as the Trump Building.[61] In the early 1990s, he won the right to develop a 70-acre (28 ha) tract in the Lincoln Square neighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, he sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who financed the project's completion, Riverside South.[62]

Trump's last major construction project was the 92-story mixed-use Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago which opened in 2008. In 2024, the New York Times and ProPublica reported that the Internal Revenue Service was investigating whether he had twice written off losses incurred through construction cost overruns and lagging sales of residential units in the building he had declared to be worthless on his 2008 tax return.[63]

In 1984, Trump opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza, a hotel and casino, with financing and management help from the Holiday Corporation.[64] It was unprofitable, and he paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control.[65] In 1985, he bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed it Trump Castle.[66] Both casinos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992.[67]

Trump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the Trump Taj Mahal. It was financed with $675 million in junk bonds and completed for $1.1 billion, opening in April 1990.[64] He filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. Under the provisions of the restructuring agreement, he gave up half his initial stake and personally guaranteed future performance.[68] To reduce his $900 million of personal debt, he sold the Trump Shuttle airline; his megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses.[69]

In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of the Trump Plaza.[70] THCR purchased the Taj Mahal and the Trump Castle in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004 and 2009, leaving him with 10 percent ownership.[64] He remained chairman until 2009.[71]

Clubs
In 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.[72] In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence.[73] He declared the club his primary residence in 2019.[56] The Trump Organization began building and buying golf courses in 1999.[74] It owns fourteen and manages another three Trump-branded courses worldwide.
