GAD can make daily life feel like a constant state of worry, fear, and dread. The good news is GAD is treatable. Learn more about the symptoms of GAD and how to find help.\\nWhat is generalized anxiety disorder?\\nOccasional anxiety is a normal part of life. Many people may worry about \\nthings such as health, money, or family problems. But people with GAD feel extremely worried or nervous more frequently about these and other things—even when there is little or no reason to worry about them. GAD usually involves a persistent feeling of anxiety or dread that interferes with how you live your life. It is not the same as occasionally worrying about things or experiencing anxiety due to stressful life events. People living with GAD experience frequent anxiety for months, if not years.\\nGAD develops slowly. It often starts around age 30, although it can occur \\nin childhood. The disorder is more common in women than in men.\\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of  \\ngeneralized anxiety disorder?\\nPeople with GAD may:\\n ●Worry excessively about everyday things\\n ●Have trouble controlling their worries or feelings of nervousness\\n ●Know that they worry much more than they should\\n ●Feel restless and have trouble relaxing\\n ●Have a hard time concentrating\\n ●Startle easily\\n ●Have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep'), Document(metadata={'source': '/mnt/c/Users/user/OneDrive/Desktop/llm-apps/mental-disorder-ai-agent/data/generalized_anxiety_disorder.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='●Tire easily or feel tired all the time \\n ●Have headaches, muscle aches, stomachaches, or unexplained pains\\n ●Have a hard time swallowing\\n ●Tremble or twitch\\n ●Feel irritable or “on edge”\\n ●Sweat a lot, feel lightheaded, or feel out of breath\\n ●Have to go to the bathroom frequently\\nChildren and teens with GAD often worry excessively about: \\n ●Their performance in activities such as school or sports\\n ●Catastrophes, such as earthquakes or war\\n ●The health of others, such as family members\\nAdults with GAD are often highly nervous about everyday circumstances, \\nsuch as: \\n ●Job security or performance\\n ●Health \\n ●Finances\\n ●The health and well-being of their children or other family members\\n ●Being late\\n ●Completing household chores and other responsibilities\\nBoth children and adults with GAD may experience physical symptoms such as pain, fatigue, or shortness of breath that make it hard to function and that interfere with daily life. \\nSymptoms may fluctuate over time and are often worse during times of \\nstress—for example—with a physical illness, during school exams, or during a family or relationship conflict.\\nWhat causes generalized anxiety disorder?\\nRisk for GAD can run in families. Several parts of the brain and biological processes play a key role in fear and anxiety. By learning more about how the brain and body function in people with anxiety disorders, researchers may be able to develop better treatments. Researchers have also found that external causes, such as experiencing a traumatic event or being in a stressful environment, may put you at higher risk for developing GAD.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/mnt/c/Users/user/OneDrive/Desktop/llm-apps/mental-disorder-ai-agent/data/generalized_anxiety_disorder.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='How is generalized anxiety disorder treated?\\nIf you think you’re experiencing symptoms of GAD, talk to a health care \\nprovider. After discussing your history, a health care provider may conduct  \\na physical exam to ensure that an unrelated physical problem is not causing your symptoms. A health care provider may refer you to a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker. The first step to effective treatment is to get a diagnosis, usually from a mental health professional. \\nGAD is generally treated with psychotherapy (sometimes called “talk \\ntherapy”), medication, or both. Speak with a health care provider about the best treatment for you.\\nPsychotherapy\\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a research-supported type of psychotherapy, is commonly used to treat GAD. CBT teaches you different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to situations that help you feel less anxious and worried. CBT has been well studied and is the gold standard for psychotherapy.\\nAnother treatment option for GAD is acceptance and commitment therapy \\n(ACT). ACT takes a different approach than CBT to negative thoughts and uses strategies such as mindfulness and goal setting to reduce your discomfort and anxiety. Compared to CBT, ACT is a newer form of psychotherapy treatment, so less data are available on its effectiveness. However, different therapies work for different types of people, so it can be helpful to discuss what form of therapy may be right for you with a mental health professional.\\nFor more information on psychotherapy, visit www.nimh.nih.gov/\\npsychotherapies .\\nMedication\\nHealth care providers may prescribe medication to treat GAD. Different types of medication can be effective, including: \\n ●Antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\\n ●Anti-anxiety medications, such as benzodiazepines'), Document(metadata={'source': '/mnt/c/Users/user/OneDrive/Desktop/llm-apps/mental-disorder-ai-agent/data/generalized_anxiety_disorder.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='SSRI and SNRI antidepressants are commonly used to treat depression, \\nbut they also can help treat the symptoms of GAD. They may take several weeks to start working. These medications also may cause side effects, such as headaches, nausea, or difficulty sleeping. These side effects are usually not severe for most people, especially if the dose starts off low and is increased slowly over time. Talk to your health care provider about any side effects that you may experience.\\nBenzodiazepines, which are anti-anxiety sedative medications, also can be \\nused to manage severe forms of GAD. These medications can be very effective in rapidly decreasing anxiety, but some people build up a tolerance to them and need higher and higher doses to get the same effect. Some people even become dependent on them. Therefore, a health care provider may prescribe them only for brief periods of time if you need them.\\nBuspirone is another anti-anxiety medication that can be helpful in treating \\nGAD. Unlike benzodiazepines, buspirone is not a sedative and has less potential to be addictive. Buspirone needs to be taken for 3–4 weeks for it to be fully effective.\\nBoth psychotherapy and medication can take some time to work. Many \\npeople try more than one medication before finding the best one for them. A health care provider can work with you to find the best medication, dose, and duration of treatment for you. \\nFor basic information about these and other mental health medications, \\nvisit www.nimh.nih.gov/medications . Visit the Food and Drug \\nAdministration’s website ( www.fda.gov/drugsatfda ) for the latest \\nwarnings, patient medication guides, and information on newly approved medications.\\nSupport Groups\\nSome people with anxiety disorders might benefit from joining a self-help or support group and sharing their problems and achievements with others. Support groups are available both in person and online. However, any advice you receive from a support group member should be used cautiously and does not replace treatment recommendations from a health care provider.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/mnt/c/Users/user/OneDrive/Desktop/llm-apps/mental-disorder-ai-agent/data/generalized_anxiety_disorder.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Healthy Habits\\nPracticing a healthy lifestyle also can help combat anxiety, although this \\nalone cannot replace treatment. Researchers have found that implementing certain healthy choices in daily life—such as reducing caffeine intake and getting enough sleep—can reduce anxiety symptoms when paired with standard care—such as psychotherapy and medication. \\nStress management techniques, such as exercise, mindfulness, and \\nmeditation, also can reduce anxiety symptoms and enhance the effects of psychotherapy.

This includes combat veterans as well as \\npeople who have experienced or witnessed a physical or sexual assault, abuse, an accident, a disaster, a terror attack, or other serious events. People who have PTSD may feel stressed or frightened, even when they are no longer in danger. \\nNot everyone with PTSD has been through a dangerous event. In some cases, \\nlearning that a relative or close friend experienced trauma can cause PTSD.\\nAccording to the National Center for PTSD, a program of the U.S. Department of \\nVeterans Affairs, about seven or eight of every 100 people will experience PTSD in their lifetime.

Certain aspects of the traumatic event and some biological factors (such as genes) may make some people more likely to develop PTSD.\\nWhat are the symptoms of PTSD?\\nSymptoms of PTSD usually begin within 3 months of the traumatic incident, but they sometimes emerge later. To meet the criteria for PTSD, symptoms must last longer than 1 month, and they must be severe enough to interfere with aspects of daily life, such as relationships or work. The symptoms also must be unrelated to medication, substance use, or other illness. \\nThe course of the illness varies: Although some people recover within 6 months, \\nothers have symptoms that last for a year or longer.

People with schizophrenia are usually diagnosed between the ages of 16 and 30, after the first episode of psychosis. Starting treatment as soon as possible following the first episode of psychosis is an important step toward recovery. However, research shows that gradual changes in thinking, mood, and social functioning often appear before the first episode of psychosis. Schizophrenia is rare in younger children. \\nSchizophrenia symptoms can differ from person to person, but they generally \\nfall into three main categories: psychotic, negative, and cognitive.\\nPsychotic symptoms\\nPsychotic symptoms\\xa0include changes in the way a person thinks, acts, and experiences the world.

For others, the symptoms become stable over time. Psychotic symptoms include:\\n ●Hallucinations: \\xa0When a person sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels things \\nthat are not actually there. Hearing voices is common for people with schizophrenia. People who hear voices may hear them for a long time before family or friends notice a problem.\\n ●Delusions: \\xa0When a person has strong beliefs that are not true and may \\nseem irrational to others. For example, individuals experiencing delusions may believe that people on the radio and television are sending special messages that require a certain response, or they may believe that they are in danger or that others are trying to hurt them.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/mnt/c/Users/user/OneDrive/Desktop/llm-apps/mental-disorder-ai-agent/data/schizophrenia.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='●Thought disorder:\\xa0When a person has ways of thinking that are unusual or \\nillogical. People with thought disorder may have trouble organizing their thoughts and speech. Sometimes a person will stop talking in the middle of a thought, jump from topic to topic, or make up words that have no meaning.\\n ●Movement disorder: \\xa0When a person exhibits abnormal body movements. \\nPeople with movement disorder may repeat certain motions over and over. \\nNegative symptoms\\nNegative symptoms\\xa0include loss of motivation, loss of interest or enjoyment in daily activities, withdrawal from social life, difficulty showing emotions, and difficulty functioning normally. Negative symptoms include:\\n ●Having trouble planning and sticking with activities, such as grocery shopping\\n ●Having trouble anticipating and feeling pleasure in everyday life\\n ●Talking in a dull voice and showing limited facial expression\\n ●Avoiding social interaction or interacting in socially awkward ways\\n ●Having very low energy and spending a lot of time in passive activities. In extreme cases, a person might stop moving or talking for a while, which is a rare condition called catatonia. \\nThese symptoms are sometimes mistaken for symptoms of depression or other mental illnesses.\\nCognitive symptoms\\nCognitive symptoms\\xa0include problems with attention, concentration, and memory. These symptoms can make it hard to follow a conversation, learn new things, or remember appointments. A person’s level of cognitive functioning is one of the best predictors of their day-to-day functioning. Cognitive functioning is evaluated using specific tests. Cognitive symptoms include:\\n ●Having trouble processing information to make decisions\\n ●Having trouble using information immediately after learning it\\n ●Having trouble focusing or paying attention\\nRisk of violence\\nMost people with schizophrenia are not violent. Overall, people with schizophrenia are more likely than those without the illness to be harmed by others. For people with schizophrenia, the risk of self-harm and of violence to others is greatest when the illness is untreated. It is important to help people who are showing symptoms to get treatment as quickly as possible.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/mnt/c/Users/user/OneDrive/Desktop/llm-apps/mental-disorder-ai-agent/data/schizophrenia.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Schizophrenia vs. dissociative identity disorder\\nAlthough some of the signs may seem similar on the surface, schizophrenia is \\nnot dissociative identity disorder (which used to be called multiple personality disorder or split personality). People with dissociative identity disorder have two or more distinct identities that are present and that alternately take control \\nof them.\\nWhat causes schizophrenia?\\nSeveral factors may contribute to a person’s risk of developing  schizophrenia, including:\\n ●Genetics. \\xa0Schizophrenia sometimes runs in families. However, just \\nbecause one family member has schizophrenia, it does not mean that other members of the family also will have it. Studies suggest that many different genes may increase a person’s chances of developing schizophrenia, but that no single gene causes the disorder by itself. \\n ●Environment.\\xa0 Research suggests that a combination of genetic factors \\nand aspects of a person’s environment and life experiences may play a role in the development of schizophrenia. These environmental factors may include living in poverty, stressful or dangerous surroundings, and exposure to viruses or nutritional problems before birth.\\n ●Brain structure and function. \\xa0Research shows that people with \\nschizophrenia may be more likely to have differences in the size of certain brain areas and in connections between brain areas. Some of these brain differences may develop before birth. Researchers are working to better understand how brain structure and function may relate to schizophrenia.\\nHow is schizophrenia treated?\\nCurrent treatments for schizophrenia focus on helping individuals manage their symptoms, improve day-to-day functioning, and achieve personal  life goals, such as completing education, pursuing a career, and having fulfilling relationships. \\nAntipsychotic medications\\nAntipsychotic medications can help make psychotic symptoms less intense and less frequent. These medications are usually taken every day in a pill or liquid form. Some antipsychotic medications are given as injections once or twice a month.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/mnt/c/Users/user/OneDrive/Desktop/llm-apps/mental-disorder-ai-agent/data/schizophrenia.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='If a person’s symptoms do not improve with usual antipsychotic medications, \\nthey may be prescribed clozapine. People who take clozapine must have regular blood tests to check for a potentially dangerous side effect that occurs in 1% to 2% of patients.\\nPeople respond to antipsychotic medications in different ways. It is important \\nto report any side effects to a health care provider. Many people taking antipsychotic medications experience side effects such as weight gain, dry mouth, restlessness, and drowsiness when they start taking these medications. Some of these side effects may go away over time, while others may last. \\nYou should not stop taking a medication without talking to your health care provider first. Your health care provider will work with you to adjust your treatment plan in a safe and effective way. Some people may need to try several medications before finding the one that works best for them, so it is important to continue with treatment and to stay hopeful.\\nYou can find the latest information on warnings, patient medication guides, or newly approved medications on the\\xa0U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website at  www.fda.gov/drugsatfda .\\nPsychosocial treatments\\nPsychosocial treatments help people find solutions to everyday challenges and manage symptoms while attending school, working, and forming relationships. These treatments are often used together with antipsychotic medication. People who participate in regular psychosocial treatment are less likely to have symptoms reoccur or to be hospitalized. \\nExamples of this kind of treatment include cognitive behavioral therapy, \\nbehavioral skills training, supported employment, and cognitive remediation interventions.\\nYou can find information about psychosocial treatments on the National \\nInstitute of Mental Health (NIMH) website at www.nimh.nih.gov/psychotherapies . \\nFamily education and support\\nEducational programs can help family and friends learn about symptoms of schizophrenia, treatment options, and strategies for helping loved ones with the illness. These programs can help friends and family manage their distress, boost their own coping skills, and strengthen their ability to provide support.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/mnt/c/Users/user/OneDrive/Desktop/llm-apps/mental-disorder-ai-agent/data/schizophrenia.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Coordinated specialty care \\nCoordinated specialty care (CSC) programs are recovery-focused programs \\nfor people with first episode psychosis, an early stage of schizophrenia. Health professionals and specialists work together as a team to provide CSC, which includes psychotherapy, medication, case management, employment and education support, and family education and support. The treatment team works collaboratively with the individual to make treatment decisions, involving family members as much as \\xa0possible. \\nCompared with typical care, CSC is more effective in reducing symptoms, improving quality of life, and increasing involvement in work or\\xa0school. \\nAssertive community treatment\\nAssertive community treatment (ACT) is designed to help individuals with schizophrenia who are likely to experience multiple hospitalizations or homelessness. ACT is usually delivered by a team of health professionals and specialists who work together to provide care to patients in the community. \\nTreatment for drug and alcohol misuse\\xa0\\nIt is common for people with schizophrenia to have problems with drugs and alcohol. A treatment program that includes treatment for both schizophrenia and substance use is important for recovery because substance use can interfere with treatment for schizophrenia. \\nHow can I find help?\\nIf you’re not sure where to get help, your health care provider is a good place to start. Your health care provider can refer you to a qualified mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist who has  \\nexperience treating schizophrenia.
